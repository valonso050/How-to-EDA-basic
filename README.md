# How to EDA? (basic)
Previously named Trial-4 because it was my fourth trial at making a definitive repo that I could work with for a small sized program, I'm sure that there are still a lot more things that I can optimize, and eventually I will learn, but for now I think this is fine.

This is indeed my first finished repo, but it won't be the last (I hope).

**This project is currently in finished**
